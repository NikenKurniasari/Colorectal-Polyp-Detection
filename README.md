# Colorectal-Polyp-Detection
Colorectal Polyp Detection Based on Image with YOLO11
The main material used in this study is a collection of secondary data in the form of colonoscopy images obtained from the private Airlangga University Hospital and colonoscopy images obtained from the Simula Datasets bank (https://datasets.simula.no/kvasir-seg/), the following is the distribution.

You Only Look Once 11 (YOLO11) is the latest iteration in the Ultralytics YOLO series of real-time object detectors, redefining what's possible with cutting-edge accuracy, speed, and efficiency. Building upon the impressive advancements of previous YOLO versions, YOLO11 introduces significant improvements in architecture and training methods, making it a versatile choice for a wide range of computer vision tasks.

In this project, image enhancement is used to improve the quality of the model input image. 
Adaptive Gamma Correction (AGC), a method of improving image quality by increasing image contrast and maintaining its brightness, where the determination of the parameters used is obtained based on the input image information. 
Highlight Removal (HR), Other brightness improvements can be made by the principle of eliminating certain areas of light reflection.
In this project, a combination of scenarios from each enhancement method was conducted to observe the effects of the treatments, including AGC, HR, AGC-HR, and HR-AGC.
